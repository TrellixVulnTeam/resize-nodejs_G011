# resize-image-nodejs

## this is a program I made to resize and compress images.
### i did a video in youtube showing the code running: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlXtQOgjpUI&ab_channel=Corona">link</a>


### It uses the image that is normally saved in the file, compresses and resizes it using the command in the terminal, and finishes.

### If you want to use it, the command is: ```node (file name.xx) (image name.xx) (image pixels)```

### With my code, I used:

``` node script.js monkey.jpg 600 ```

### In addition to the libraries that already come with node, I downloaded "sharp", and <link>"compress-images"
